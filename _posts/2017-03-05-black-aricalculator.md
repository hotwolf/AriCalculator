title:  Black AriCalculator
---

In August last year I published the AriCalculator as "recipe" on the 
[Seed Studio comunity pages](https://www.seeed.cc/AriCalculator-A-homemade-handheld-calculator-p-1844.html). 
In return I received a discount on PCBs, which I spend on a set of 
back AriCalculator boards. This is how they look assembled.

The black solder mask prvides a better contrast to the laser engraved lables.

Overall black is a pretty niche color for the AriCalculator.
