title: RevC Boards and Enclosures Have Arrived
---

My order of RevC boards and enclosures has come in the mail.

This is the first time, that I've added tiny spark gaps to all exposed board inputs. They turned out well (no shorts).

For the enclosure of RevC, I've tried out "Seeedstudio's":http://www.seeedstudio.com new laser engraving service.

I'm sure it wasn't easy to burn the small print of the calculator's keyboard lables into the clear acrylic cover. 
The people at "Seeedstudio":http://www.seeedstudio.com were so nice to and experimented with my design to improve 
readability. In the end they send me two versions of the engraved front covers. One has a filled font (this is basically 
what my original design looked like):

The other variation uses an outlined font.

I think they both turned out well. 

Now I need to come up with a good way to color the engraved labeling. Maybe I should have ordered black PCBs instead of white ones.
