title: RevC Boards and Enclosures Have Arrived
---

<p>My order of RevC boards and enclosures has come in the mail.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/AriCalculatorRevCPcbs.png" alt="" /><br />
This is the first time that I&#8217;ve added tiny spark gaps to all exposed board inputs. They turned out well (no shorts).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/AriCalculatorRevCSparkGaps2.png" alt="" /> <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/AriCalculatorRevCSparkGaps1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>For the enclosure of RevC, I&#8217;ve tried out <a href="//www.seeedstudio.com">Seeedstudio&#8217;s</a> new laser engraving service.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/AriCalculatorRevCEnclosuresPacked.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it wasn&#8217;t easy to burn the small print of the calculator&#8217;s keyboard lables into the clear acrylic cover. <br />
The people at <a href="//www.seeedstudio.com">Seeedstudio</a> were really nice and experimented with my design to improve <br />
readability. In the end they sent me two versions of the engraved front covers. One has a filled font (this is basically <br />
what my original design looked like):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/AriCalculatorRevCEnclosureFilledFontFront.png" alt="" /> <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/AriCalculatorRevCEnclosureFilledFontBack.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The other variation uses an outlined font.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/AriCalculatorRevCEnclosureHollowFontFront.png" alt="" /> <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/AriCalculatorRevCEnclosureHollowFontBack.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I think they both turned out well.</p>
<p>Now I need to come up with a good way to color the engraved labeling. Maybe I should have ordered black PCBs instead of white ones.</p>
