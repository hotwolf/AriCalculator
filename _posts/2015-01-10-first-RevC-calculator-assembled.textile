title: First RevC Calculator Assembled
---

The first RevC calculator nas been built. I still need to do something to improve the contrast of the keypad labels.

RevC comes with lasercut acrylic spacers.

I was out of 1uF SMD capacitors, but the PCB has enough room for through hole components.

During the PCB assembly I've discoverd one design bug: LED1 and LED2 have been flipped the wrong way around in the 
"schemactics":https://github.com/hotwolf/AriCalculator/raw/master/Hardware/RevC/AriCalculator-RevC%20Schematic.pdf. Therefore the cathode markings
 on the silkscreen are on the wrong side. The design files have been corrected in the current git commit.

There had also been a mistake in the "assembly plan":https://github.com/hotwolf/AriCalculator/raw/master/Hardware/RevC/AriCalculator-RevC%20Assembly%20Plan.pdf: 
resistor labels R9 and R10 had been swapped (also fixed in the current commit).

A further pitfall is the orientation of resistors R11 and R12. The "assembly plan":https://github.com/hotwolf/AriCalculator/raw/master/Hardware/RevC/AriCalculator-RevC%20Assembly%20Plan.pdf
 didn't give any hint that they need to be mounted horizontally, whereas all neighboring components ate aligned vertically.
