title: Redesign Complete
---

<p>The prototype of the AriCalculator (RevA) is no longer usable. It has been destroyed in an attempt to replace a broken <span class="caps">FTDI</span> <span class="caps">USB</span> to serial converter. After a first attempt to fix the prototype&#8217;s design flaws with incremental changes (RevB), I&#8217;ve decided to do a full redesign (RevC):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/AriCalculatorRevC3dModel.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The new design no longer uses a milled <span class="caps">PCB</span> in combination with an <a href="//hotwolf.github.io/S12G-Micro-EVB">S12-Micro-<span class="caps">EVB</span></a>. Instead it uses a single <span class="caps">PCB</span>, which makes assembly and repairs much easier. The new design has new features like an extended keypad (38 instead of 30 keys), an expansion port (<span class="caps">SPI</span>), and a back ight option for the display. However, it is not fully compatible to the previous designs.</p>
<p>PCBs and enclosures have already been ordered and should arrive in January 2015.</p>
