S12CForth
========= 
S12CForth is aa ANS Forth implementation for Freescale's S12(X) 
microcontroller families, writen in assembly language. It is based on the 
S12CBase framework (https://github.com/hotwolf/S12CBase) and supports the
following hardware:

	   - Mini-BDM-Pod      (https://github.com/hotwolf/Mini-BDM-Pod)
	   - LFBDMPGMR         (S08/S12 programmer by Freescale)
           - S12G-Micro-EVB    (https://github.com/hotwolf/S12G-Micro-EVB)
	   - S12DP256-Mini-EVB (plain MC9HCS12DP256 evaluation board)
           - AriCalculator     (https://github.com/hotwolf/AriCalculator)
           - SIMCH12           (free HC12 simulator)
