AriCalculator
=============
A homemade pocket calculator.

RevC is a redesign of the AriCalculator which breaks compatibility with the 
previous revisions. It is build with a single PCB instead of a combination of
S12G-Mini-EVB and millede base PCB. RevC has 38 keys (instead of 30) and
features an expansion port (SPI). All firmware development of the AriCalculator 
will be done on RevC.
