AriCalculator
=============
A homemade pocket calculator.

These direcories contain the design files of all three hardware revisions.

Directories:
============
|
+-RevA                  - This is the first prototype of the AriCalculator. It
|                         is based on the S12G-Mini-EVB RevA board in
|                         combination with a milled base PCB.
|
+-RevB                  - RevB fixes bugs found on RevA. It is based on 
|                         S12G-Mini-EVB RevB, also with a milled base PCB
|                         RevB has never been build.
|
+-RevC                  - RevC uses a single PCB instead of a combination of
                          S12G-Mini-EVB and milled base PCB. It breaks 
                          compatibility with its predecessors in terms of user
                          interface (more keys) and GPIO assignments of the S12G
                          MCU. All firmware development will be done on RevC.
