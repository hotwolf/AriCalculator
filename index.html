<p><strong>AriCalculator</strong> is a home made pocket calculator.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>The current hardware is based on the <a href="https://hotwolf.github.com/S12G-Micro-EVB">S12G Micro EVB</a> using a 
<a href="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=S12G">MC9S12G128 micro controller</a> from 
<a href="http://www.freescale.com">Freescale</a>. 
However, this board can be easily replaced by other microcontroller boards of this form factor. 
The micro controller board is mounted on a milled main board, which also holds a 5&#215;7 key matrix and a 
128&#215;64 dot matrix reflective LCD (ST7565R connected via SPI).</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>The software for the AriCalculator will be written in <a href="http://hotwolf.github.com/S12CForth">Forth</a>. 
This will make it easier to port it to other platform and to add new features.</p>
