<p><strong>AriCalculator</strong> is a project I plan to do with my daughter. 
The plan is to build our own calculator, by the time she is allowed to use one in school. 
Let&#8217;s see how we&#8217;ll do.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>The current hardware is based on the <a href="https://hotwolf.github.com/S12G-Micro-EVB">S12G Micro EVB</a> using a 
<a href="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=S12G">MC9S12G128 micro controller</a> from 
<a href="http://www.freescale.com">Freescale</a>. 
However, this board can be easily replaced by other microcontroller boards of this form factor. 
The micro controller board is mounted on a milled main board, which also holds a 5&#215;7 key matrix and a 
128&#215;64 dot matrix reflective LCD (ST7565R connected via SPI).</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>The software for the AriCalculator will be written in <a href="http://hotwolf.github.com/S12CForth">Forth</a>. 
Forth has the advantage, that&#8230;</p>

<ul>
	<li>&#8230;the firmware will be platform independant and can be run on other MCUs with compatible Forth implementation.</li>
	<li>&#8230;it is a great language to teach programming.</li>
	<li>&#8230;compiler and <span class="caps">IDE</span> are running on the <span class="caps">MCU</span> itself. All we need on the PC side is a terminal emulator and an editor.</li>
</ul>
